I left my house to go buy some Gebaeck
I got in my BMW and started driving.
I drove down the hauptstrasse to the airport.
I drove to the Flughafen to fly to Berlin.
All I wanted was to find a good Baeckerei.
So I kept on driving and listening to Musik.
Finally I came across a cart selling brot.
I swerved into the nearest parking lot and parked next to a Porsche.
